STEPS: 

1. Create server directory
2. Move to server directory and run 'npm init -y' and 'npm i express' commands.
3. Create server.js file
4. Create the server, middlewares and CRUD routes (get, post, put, delete)
5. Connect to PG Database:

* npm i pg on server directory
* Create db folder -> create index.js file there -> write lines to connect to PG database.

ON DB/INDEX FILE:

import pkg from "pg";
const { Pool } = pkg

const pool = new Pool({
    user: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    database: "restaurant-review-app",
    password: "12345",
    port: 5432
}) //Creamos una instancia de Pool() (sirve para conectarnos a la BD)

5. Create Restaurant API (Using axios and exporting the baseurl)
6. Create the methods for when you're trying to change the DB (use the baseurl, add what you need, use get, post, put or delete and store the response in a variable)
   use async/await and usse the response to trigger the DB actions.

7. Create a restaurant context using useContext and pass to every component the state (That will show the restaurants from the DB to the UI), the setState function,
   And all the other methods you'll need to execute the app.
